# Insurance Cost Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project implements a linear regression model to predict insurance costs based on a person's age. The goal is to create a predictive model that can estimate insurance premiums based on the age of an individual. This is useful for insurance companies and individuals alike to understand how age impacts insurance costs.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following information:

- **Age**: The age of the individual.
- **Insurance Cost**: The insurance premium or cost for the individual.

The dataset is stored in a CSV file, `insurance.csv`, with columns for Age and Insurance Cost.

## Features
- **Linear Regression Model**: A simple linear regression model that predicts insurance costs based on age.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes the relationship between age and insurance cost.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
